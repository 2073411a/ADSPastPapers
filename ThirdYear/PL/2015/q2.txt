a) The lifetime of a variable is the amount of the program which the variable is available for access for.
Program Lifetime:
    i
        p():
            y
        q():
            x
b) The new variable would be precedence over the orignal when i is reffered too for the duration of the function p, after which it would revert to the orginal i, with the information pointed to by the new i being made available for overriding.
c) SHAPE = {0,1,2}
   COMPONENT = SHAPE * int = {1,2,3} * { ...,-1,0,1,....}
   PICTURE = {COMPONENT, COMPONENT, COMPONENT...}
d) 
public class Circle{
    int radius;
}
public class Rectangle{
    int width;
    int hieght;
}
e) As the shape class is abstract, no objects of it's type can be made, therefore there would be no changes to the equation.
f) instrad of saying what kind of primative type the object, we would instead specifiy the values for example Circle 1, Circle 2 ..... Rectangle (1x1), Rectange(1x2) .....
