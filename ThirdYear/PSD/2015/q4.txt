a) The steps in refactoring are:
    - 1: Identify refactoring opportunity
    - 2: create test case
    - 3: plan refactoring
    - 4: apply refactoring
    - 5: run tests
    - 6: if tests fail, go to 3, else go to 7
    - 7: commit
b) The makeCoffee() method is too long, this could be fixed by separating
parts of this into other methods.
   There is repeated code in the if - else if block in the make coffee
method. This could be fixed by creating a new addSugar() method.
   The use of a large amount block of if - elseif statements indicated a
reluctance to exploit object polymorphism, this could be fixed by
introducing a super class or interface for these classes to better take
advantage of object polymorphism.
c)i) context Film::name inv: length < 50
 ii) context Showing : Showing->count(Tickts)::Integer = count implies
                       count <= Theatre.capacity
iii) context Showing inv: ticket.type = JUNIOR implies Film.rating = U or
                                                       Film.rating = PG
 iv)
  context Showing inv: ticket-> t1| t1.type = JUNIOR and Film.rating = PG
                       implies
                       ticket->exists(t2 | t1.group = t2.group and
                                           t2.type = ADULT)
