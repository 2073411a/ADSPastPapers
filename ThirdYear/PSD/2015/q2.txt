a) "Integration Hell" refers to issues caused by devlopers attempting to intergrate two or more branches which are significantly different from each other, often caused by not having frequent enough changes.
b)  Have everyone commit to the mainline at least once a day. This helps byensuring that the project is never more than a day out of sync between devlopers.

    Everyone can see what's happening. This ensures that the devlopers don't commit before checking out any newer ones.

iii) Firstly, the tasks should be planned at the start of the project, rather than throughout.
