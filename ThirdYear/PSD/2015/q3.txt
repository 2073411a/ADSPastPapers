a) test driven development is a method of development where the developer develops
a set of tests first, then writes the code for that section afterwards.
Behaviour driven is an extension of test driven development where the tests are
written in domain specific language to convert structured natural language
into tests. Test driven development is best for when trying to test very
specific features such as edge cases, particularly for aspects that may not be
seen by users. BDD is better for testing that user stories are met and
focusing on the end functionality of the software.

moving all implementation decisions into configuration, requiring the
platform to be configured on top of an existing software system.
