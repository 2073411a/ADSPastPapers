Scenario:

The United Kingdom has a number of long distance hiking trails, such as the Pennine Way, the Coast to Coast Trail and the West Highland Way. Hikers will typically take a number of days to complete a particular route, and so stop in accommodation, such as hotels, hostels and campsites along the way. Many hikers don’t like to carry all of their luggage with them during the day, so a number of ‘porter’ companies provide transportation for this excess luggage between stops, as well as collection points at the start and ends of the trails.

Accommodation owners register their business as a venue where luggage can be deposited and collected by the porters. Hikers can then also register with the porter and book collections and drop offs for their trip. Many hikers like to able to book whole sequences of collections and drop-offs for preset itineraries, as these are discounted by the porters because it makes demand easier to predict.

However, some hikers also like to be able to vary the standard itineraries (subject to a charge) in order to make time for rest days to enjoy exploring a particular town or site. Alternatively, some sections of a trail between official stops can be completed in more than one day (the hikers will take a tent with them and wild camp overnight).

Book-a-Porter are hoping to develop a new service for trail hikers. Rather than transport luggage themselves, Book-a-Porter want to create a market for luggage porting. They want to create an application that allows potential porters to register their availability (dates, times, routes and prices). Porters will also need to provide assurance information (such as driving licence and insurance details) in order to be allowed to bid for work. Hikers can then search for a porter that provides the best deal for them. The idea is that the site will provide a single location for the different existing companies to compete, but also allow smaller occasional porters to participate (two venues might be on a person’s daily commute to work for example).
