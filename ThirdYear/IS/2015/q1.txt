1a) The gulf of execution is what is what is needed to transform the users intentions into the appropriate actions. The gulf of evaluation is what is needed to interperet the physical state of the system, and to determine how well it matches the users intentions. In a command langaue the gulf of evaluation is larger as there is generaly little, if any, feedback is given on user actions.
b) Recognition is a type of long term memory retrival where information is gained from seeing something that has been see before. Recall on the other hand, is a form of long term memory information retrievial in which the information is gained for cues. In an interface, recognition is better as it provides more information to the user, and makes it more likely the user will be able to properly remember what the correct commands are.
c) Standards are distinct from other design rules in that they are designed to enforce certian methods and technologies as standard, whilst design rules are focussed on ensuring that the implemtation of these technologies and methods is done in an effective way. These standards are generally created by indpendent bodies such as the world wide web consortium, often invloving members of relevent technology companies such as google, amazon etc. These standards can be problematic as they can hinder the adoption of new technologies or methods, particularly if members of the relevent bodies have an intreset in avoiding them.
d) Design:
    - Test users would be split into three groups, one for each icon.
    - All test users would be given a cluttered screen with thier icon in a set location. As a control vairiable, the screen would be kept the same for all users, with the only difference being what icon the user has, making the icons the only indpendent variable.
    - The dependent variable in this experiment is the time taken to locate and press the app-icon. This would be tracked for each user.
    - The average time for each group could be found and using this, the one that was fastest to be located would be the logical choice as the icon to be used.
