1a) The gulf of execution is what is what is needed to transform the user’s intentions into the appropriate actions. The gulf of evaluation is what is needed to interpret the physical state of the system, and to determine how well it matches the user’s intentions. In a command language the gulf of evaluation is larger as there is generally little, if any, feedback is given on user actions.
b) Recognition is a type of long term memory retrieval where information is gained from seeing something that has been see before. Recall on the other hand, is a form of long term memory information retrieval in which the information is gained for cues. In an interface, recognition is better as it provides more information to the user, and makes it more likely the user will be able to properly remember what the correct commands are.
c) Standards are distinct from other design rules in that they are designed to enforce certain methods and technologies as standard, whilst design rules are focussed on ensuring that the implantation of these technologies and methods is done in an effective way. These standards are generally created by independent bodies such as the world wide web consortium, often involving members of relevant technology companies such as google, amazon etc. These standards can be problematic as they can hinder the adoption of new technologies or methods, particularly if members of the relevant bodies have an interest in avoiding them.
d) Design:
    - Test users would be split into three groups, one for each icon.
    - All test users would be given a cluttered screen with their icon in a set location. As a control variable, the screen would be kept the same for all users, with the only difference being what icon the user has, making the icons the only independent variable.
    - The dependent variable in this experiment is the time taken to locate and press the app-icon. This would be tracked for each user.
    - The average time for each group could be found and using this, the one that was fastest to be located would be the logical choice as the icon to be used.
