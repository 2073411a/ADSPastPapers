a) i) The second possibility is more efficient as it only has to perform the respective for loop operation half as much as in the first one, saving a significant amount of operations.
  ii) As the default value for a non-allocated float value is 0.0, the fastest way to initialize would be to not do anything.
    Alterative:
for (k=0; k < (n + 1)/2; k ++){
    a[k].re = 0.0;
    a[n - 1 - k].re = 0.0;
    a[k].im = 0.0;
    a[n - 1 - k].im = 0.0;
}
Saves just under half of the operation involving loops.
b) There is not a deadlock as process P3 can complete, freeing the necessary resources for P1 and P2. This can be shown by constructing a resource allocaion/request/available table

Proccess | Allocation | Request | Available
---------|------------|---------|----------
         | R1  R2     | R1  R2  | R1  R2
P1       | 1   0      | 0   1   | 0   0
P2       | 0   1      | 1   0   |
P3       | 1   1      | 0   0   |
From this we can see that process P3 has enough resources to satisfy both requests, and is not requesting any itself, allowing it to complete
c) i) File header
  ii) File directory
 iii) File directory
  iv) File directory
   v) File directory
  vi) File data block
d) i) This will make it slower as it would force the disk head to jump around the tracks to read, or preform any operations on the file.
  ii) This will make it faster as it allows the data in frequently accessed files to be loaded quickly
 iii) This would make it faster as it would save time in the disk head reach its destination quicker
  iv) This may make it faster as it would reduce seek time, however as it may require the disk to override those files at the centre it could also increase time overall.
