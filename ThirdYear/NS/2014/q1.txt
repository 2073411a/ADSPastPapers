a)i) In symmetric cryptography there is only one key, which is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. In public key cryptography, there are two, one to encrypt and another to decrypt, these keys work either way around.
ii)  Public-key cryptography solves the issues of distributing the keys, as only the public key needs to be known, whereas for symmetric cryptography the key must somehow be sent alongside the data.
b)   TLS uses a hybrid system due to the speed difference in encryption, with symmetric being much faster to encrypt than public key. It is done by creating a session key, then distributing it via public key cryptography, and using the session key to symmetrically encrypt the much larger data that is being sent over it. This ensures security as the key will be encrypted, preventing it from being read, and allowing the data to be securely transported using that key.
c)    A digital signature is a cryptographic hash of the data, encrypted with a private key. This value can be recalculated when the sender receives the data, if this value is the same as the one sent with the data, then the received data is from the original sender, otherwise it has been opened and re-encrypted by someone else, as the man-in-the-middle won't have access to the private key.
