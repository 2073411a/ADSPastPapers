a)i) In symetric cryptography there is only one key, which is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. In public key cryptorgaphy, there are two, one to encrypt and another to decrypt, these keys work either way arround.
ii)  Public-key cryptography solves the issues of distrobuting the keys, as only the public key needs to be known, where as for symmetric crypotography the key must somehow be sent allong side the data.
b)   TLS uses a hybrid system due to the speed difference in encryption, with symetric being much faster to encrypt than public key. It is done by creating a session key, then distrobuting it via public key cryptography, and using the session key to symetrically encrypt the much larger data that is being sent over it. This ensures security as the key will be encrypted, preventing it form being read, and allowing the data to be securely trasported using that key.
c)    A digital signiture is a cryptographic hash of the data, encyprted with the a private key. This value can be recalculated when the sender recives the data, if this value is the same as the one sent with the data, then the recvied data is from the original sender, oterwise it has been opened and re-encrypteted by someone else, as the man-in-the-middle won't have access to the private key.
