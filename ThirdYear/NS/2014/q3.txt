a)i)  Initialy, the local caches would allow the internet to function normally, however, when one link fails and the chache attempts to update at the root, it would be unable to do so, in effect lossing that website address forever. This would continue as each website's ip changed or was updated, or the cache attmepted a manual update, causing, eventually, all names to be lost.
ii)   This failure would cause any application not using the ip-address it is connecting to, particularly those with the domain name hard-coded, to fail as the servers they are attmepting to connect to change ip from the one cached.
b)    From a buisness perspective this is certinally a good thing, as it adds more ways for companies who share a name with larger ones to have a website using their names, which can be a good boost to customer relations and for advertising. From a social perspective, this may not be a good thing, as many people may not remeber the tld of the buisness they are attempting to connect to, resuting in frustration when they get the wrong buisness due to inputing, for example, .com instead of .comp .
c) As the DNS infrastructure is made up of a hierarchacil sieries of servers, this should either lighten the load, or have no effect on existing servers, aside from the root servers, which will have more connection options to consider each time a request is made. This is due to each TLD having a septerate server that is connected directly to the root for finding connections outwith it's domain, giving the root server more to compare to, whilst either lightining the load on lower servers, if some domains migrate to the new ones, or keeping them at a similar load if few to none do so.
