3a) The main benifit of the stack approach is the seperation of concernes. This
allows the software to be devloped for one layer without having to consider the
other layers. This is much better than a monolithic approach in which the 
entire system must be considered when ever attempting to create a new network 
application.
    Another benifit is that this method saves on work, again by avoiding the 
need to devlop software for the other layers. Again, in a monolithic approach 
it would be required to either create the software each time, or to at least 
install the software for the layers as part of the software being designed.
One of the main issues of this approach is the requirement for any layer, other
than the top one, to provide services to the layer(s) above it. This can cause 
issues as it likey require complying to certian standards which may limit the 
options for devlopment. This is not a concern for monolithic devlopment, as it 
is self contained.
b) Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session 
Layer, Presentation Layer, Application Layer
c) The algorithm starts by giving each bridge in the network a unique adress. 
The root bridge is the bridge with the lowest address, each bridge has a root 
port which is the port closest to the root bridge. In the case of a network of 
lans, there will also be a designated bridge. Once these are designed, all 
other ports are disabled, leaving a spaning tree i.e. no cycles. For instance, 
condsider 3 lans, each having 4 devices - one of which servers as a router 
contecting to the corrosponding routers in the other lans. In this example, the
non router devices would each connect to the router with a desginated port, 
closing all other ports, whilst the two routers with the highest value of 
port number closing the ports connected to each other.
