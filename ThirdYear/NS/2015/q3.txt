3a) The main benefit of the stack approach is the separation of concerns. This
allows the software to be developed for one layer without having to consider the
other layers. This is much better than a monolithic approach in which the
entire system must be considered whenever attempting to create a new network
application.
    Another benefit is that this method saves on work, again by avoiding the
need to develop software for the other layers. Again, in a monolithic approach
it would be required to either create the software each time, or to at least
install the software for the layers as part of the software being designed.
One of the main issues of this approach is the requirement for any layer, other
than the top one, to provide services to the layer(s) above it. This can cause
issues as it likely require complying to certain standards which may limit the
options for development. This is not a concern for monolithic development, as it
is self-contained.
b) Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session
Layer, Presentation Layer, Application Layer
c) The algorithm starts by giving each bridge in the network a unique address.
The root bridge is the bridge with the lowest address, each bridge has a root
port which is the port closest to the root bridge. In the case of a network of
lans, there will also be a designated bridge. Once these are designed, all
other ports are disabled, leaving a spanning tree i.e. no cycles. For instance,
consider 3 lans, each having 4 devices - one of which serves as a router
connecting to the corresponding routers in the other lans. In this example, the
non router devices would each connect to the router with a designated port,
closing all other ports, whilst the two routers with the highest value of
port number closing the ports connected to each other.
