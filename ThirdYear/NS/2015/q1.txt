1a) The difference between the two algorithms is the scope at which they
operate, itra-domain operates within a single autonomous system where as
inter-domain operates between networks. For example, an intra-domain routing
algorithm might operate over one building, where as in inter-domain algorithm
is used in things such as the world wide web, connecting multiple AS.
b) Each host stores a table of the distance to every other node in the network,
as well as the next node in the path to that node. Periodically it exchanges
this information with its neighbours, allowing the shortest path to be worked
out.
c) In link state routing, every node has a complete map of the network
including the cost of travels from each node to its neighbours. This
calculation uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, taking O(n^2), making it slower than the
distance vector algorithm with is O(n).
The Distance vector algorithm is also easier to implement, as it only needs to
update its table, not work out the shortest path.
However, the link-state routing reaches the optimal solution after much less
information has been sent than Distance vector routing.
d) The Gao-Rexford rules are to advertise all routes from customers to everyone
, whilst only advertising routes from peers and provides to customers. These
are desirable as it would make the shortest route one that routes through the
top level, rather than leaving the AS, and thus risking privacy being
compromised, as well as generally being more stable.
