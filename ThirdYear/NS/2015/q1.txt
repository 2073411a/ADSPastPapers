1a) The differnce between the two algrothims is the scope at which they 
opperate, itra-domain opertates within a single autnomous system where as 
inter-domain operates between networks. For example, an intra-domain routing 
algorthim might opperate over one building, where as in interdomain algrithin 
is used in things such as the world wide web, connecting multiple AS.
b) Each host stores a table of the distance to every other node in the network,
as well as the next node in the path to that node. Periodically it exchanges 
this information with it's nieghbours, allowing the shortest path to be worked 
out.
c) In link state routing, every node has a complete map of the network 
including the cost of travsel from each node to its nieghbours. This 
calculation uses djistra's algorthim, taking O(n^2), making it slower than the 
distance vector algorithm with is O(n).
The Distance vector algorithm is also easier to implement, as it only needs to 
update its table, not work out the shortest path.
However, the link-state routing reaches the optimal solution after much less 
information has be sent than Distance vector routing.
d) The Gao-Rexford rules are to advertise all routes from coustmers to everyone
, whilst only advertising routes from peers and provides to customers. These 
are desiriable as it would make the shortest route one that routes through the 
top level, rather than leaving the AS, and thus risking privacy being 
compromised, as well as generally being more stable.
