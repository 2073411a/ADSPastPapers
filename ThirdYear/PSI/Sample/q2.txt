a) This would be violating the Data Protection act (1998) in several ways. Firstly it is storing the information than is longer than nessessary, storing every applicants data for 10 years when many of them would not need their data stored for more than the review proccess. It also allows any employee access to all the data, which is clearly not keeping with the acts requirement to provide "Appropriate technical and organisational measures" against "unauthorised or unlawful proccessing of personal data"
b) This would have social issues due to there being no international pornographic laws or, with few exceptions, even consensus on who should be allowed access to it, this would cause a problem as either the users location would have to be checked whenever accessing, or the organisation would have to enforce a single countries views on all pronographic content.
c) This presents ethical problems for the journelist, as on one hand they may feel that, as this information could potentialy avoid harm, or even death, to users, they are obligated to share it. On the other hand, as the employee is not an expert on the dynamics of vehicals, it is possible that the company has already considered these conditions in the design of the vehical, making publishing this defamation of said company.
d) This raises the social and legal issues around to what extent software copywrite applies. In this case whilst the UI and functionallity may be similar, following the precedent of the Navitaire vs easyJet cast, the UI coppywrite could be upheld, however the functionality could not, leading to either a minimal case, or simply requiring that the app redisgns the UI.
