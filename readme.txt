This is my answers for the ADS past papers (possibly also the exercises, depending on time). Format for most of these is the source code in the paper written out (with any necessary changes such as returning null in the example functions). You can find the unmodified versions in the original folder, which will compile from there.

If you think you have a better,alternate, or actually correct :p answer for anything, contact me and I'll try and add it + credit you if you want.

With just over 24 hours left before the exam I just want to quickly say thank you to everyone who's help contribute, this has been a much bigger thing than I thought it would be (almost 4000 views and 20 - 40 visistors a day!). I'd also just like to say that if thinks one of the answers here is right, but they just don't quite get it, feel free to message me and I'll try and explain it it helps me at least as much as it help you :p.

Thanks for reading and contributing :) - Duncan Adamson
