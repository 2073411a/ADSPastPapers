This is my answers for the ADS past papers (possibly also the exercises, depending on time). Format for most of these is the source code in the paper written out (with any necessary changes such as returning null in the example functions). You can find the unmodified versions in the original folder, which will compile from there.
If you think you have a better,alternate, or actually correct :p answer for anything, contact me and I'll try and add it + credit you if you want.
Thanks -Duncan
