This is my repository for crowd sourcing answers to past papers for the various comp-sci subjects as I go through them. Feel free to browse, or if you think you can help, to contribute.
If you do want to contribute, just message me Here, on Facebook, or by Email (provided bellow) (I'm only really able to help with 3rd year stuff atm, so if someone wants to takeover 2nd year things that might be quite helpful)
Good luck with exams :)
