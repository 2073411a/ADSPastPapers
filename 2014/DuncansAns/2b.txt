Radix sort is a sorting algorithm releted to pigeon hole sort, Radic sort creates 10 holes, then places the numbers from the data set into the re;event hole, mainting the order they were orginally in when sharing a hole. Initialy the data is sorted by the least signifcant didgit then the next least significant. This is repeated untill the most signifcant digit is reached. After each digit is sorted, the dataset is replaced by the ordered list. Radix sort has complexity (n.d) where d is the amount of digits in the largest value.
This would be sutible to use as it would allow the data to be sorted by the name primarily, then the height.
