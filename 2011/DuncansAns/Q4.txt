4 a) A hash table is a data structure where values are stored in a table, and are accessable by a key. They are usefull when you wish to quickly access data from a large set that has obvoisus devisions, such as name.
b) A hash function is a function that takes a key and returns a reffernce to the corrisonding hash table. We would like it to return different refferences for every different key.
c) A collision is when the hash functon generates a reference that is allready in use for a different key.
d) In seperate chaining, the hash table contains an auxilery data structure such as an array so that, when an collision occours, it can be added to the auxillery data structure.
e) In linear probing, when a collision occours, the function checks the next value in the table, if it's null it adds the value at that part, if not, it continues to check until it finds a null value.  For finding it will check the value given by the funciton, then, if that does not contain the key, it checks the next one, and so on, untill it finds the value or reaches a null value. With the remove function, when a value is removed, the function will then go across the rest of the values and move them back one, until it reaches a null value.
