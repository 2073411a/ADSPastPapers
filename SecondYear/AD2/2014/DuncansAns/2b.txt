Radix sort is a sorting algorithm related to pigeon hole sort, Radix sort creates 10 holes, then places the numbers from the data set into the relevant hole, maintaining the order they were originally in when sharing a hole. Initially the data is sorted by the least significant digit then the next least significant. This is repeated until the most significant digit is reached. After each digit is sorted, the dataset is replaced by the ordered list. Radix sort has complexity (n.d) where d is the amount of digits in the largest value.
This would be suitable to use as it would allow the data to be sorted by the name primarily, then the height.
